#### Introduction
1. Project Overview
>The purpose of this system is to be able to make a very quick purchase, with particular focus being pointed at purchasing footwear. Not intended to be a “catch-all," being able to hit any site, but this project is aimed at implementing a system that allows for a purchase of a shoe from some specific site not yet determined
2. Project Deliverables
- All items to be delivered, including delivery dates and location
- Items to be delivered:
    -  Class Diagram
    -  Use Cases
    -  Tool Rundown
    -  Estimated costs breakdown
    -  Cost(s) to consumer
    -  Cost(s) to build
3. Evolution of the SPMP
- Should it become unlawful to develop the system:
    -  The project should pivot from being software that aims to make an immediate pivot in redesign and refocus to another purpose entirely
- If costs to run/host/test project becomes exorbitant:
    -  Update professor immediately and seek alternative demonstration methods to alleviate burden

4. Reference Materials 
- Tentative:
    -  Reference link to any possible python library
    -  Reference links to selenium
    -  Reference links to any project guides used

    - The system may be subjected to defences towards this type of project on various site(s) the project may target, and navigating those defences may be questionable legality
    - Time constraints, the idea of the project in full, really is a fully fledged one. That stated, while the 2-month timeframe may prove ambitious to be fully rolled out and bug-free. Striving towards it is the goal in mind
